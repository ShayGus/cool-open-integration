This is an open source integration for the CoolMaster online cloud service. In opposed to the local CoolMaster integration, this integration will work with devices locked to work only with the cloud (iocControl)

In Order to use this integration, your devices need to be registered with iocControl and you need to have a valid username and password for the service.

When installing the integration all of your controllable units will be added to Home Assistant. Currently the integration only supports HVAC units and doesn't support water heaters.
